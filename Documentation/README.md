# Technical Module Documentation

This directory hosts deep-dive technical docs for backend modules and how the Admin/User Panels will integrate with each. Each file targets engineering use: data flows, APIs, extension points, operational concerns.

## Completed Docs

- Error Handling (`Errors.md`)

## Planned Docs
- Authentication & Sessions
- Multi-Tenancy & Tenant Resolution

- Webhooks Delivery Pipeline
- Audit Logging & Domain Events
- Metrics & Observability (Prometheus + OTEL)
- Rate Limiting & Idempotency
- Backups & Restore Runbook
- Alerting System
- Queue & Jobs Architecture
- SDK Generation & Client Integration

Add new docs incrementally; keep each file self-contained.
